Conceptually, each catchment has an outflow hydro nexus, and any hydro nexus has a corresponding catchment, even if catchment and/or hydro nexus may not be present in a particular application. A catchment interacts with upper and lower catchments via associated hydro nexuses, and ultimately contributes flow to the hydro nexus of a containing catchment. The catchment should be understood as the logical link between two hydro nexuses.\r\n\r\nThe HY_Catchment feature type captures the union of catchment and hydro nexus, and the multiple realizations of the holistic catchment concept. These realizations include both topological realizations, as well as their geometric representation. HY_Catchment may be further specialized with respect to catchment interaction. \r\n\r\nThe HY_Catchment feature type (Figure 26) specializes the general HY_HydroFeature type.
