== Introduction

In September 2024, the ontology was updated to include the concept of 'infoset'.   It adds to the previous model, therefore the linkage between real things and the datasets remains the same. This additions was necessary to provide collection of things, or more accurately, a collection of data about things.

== Ontology

   * Things (real things in the world)  also called a NIR ( Non-Information Resource, because the resource represents a real thing, therefore is a non-information) are identified by URI with a `/id/`.
   * Dataset, which are chunk of binary data, either text or images,  are presented in various formats (HTML, CSV, ERML) also called IR (Information URI) because the resource are machine readable bits of information.
   * Infoset are collections of datasets. 
   * A thing can be the subject of a dataset.
   * An Infoset can be concretized by a dataset

    ].
---- 

In this simplified example, we kept the essential statements to describe the relationship between the important elements

   * `<id/MineralOccurrence/BC/082ENE001>` a mineral occurrence
   * `<info/Infoset/BC/MineralOccurrence>` an `Infoset` (a collection)
   * dataset are represented as `blank nodes` delimited by [ and ] which are anonymous resources
   * dataset have providers (sources)

This example says that the mineral occurrence `<id/MineralOccurrence/BC/082ENE001>` is the subject of a dataset in html located at  "http://minfile.gov.bc.ca/Summary.aspx?minfilno=082ENE001".  This dataset (the data represented in the HTML page) is part (partially concretizes) of a larger infoset `<info/Infoset/BC/MineralOccurrence>` that (completely) concretized by a dataset in ERML (one of the possible format) located at "http://apps.empr.gov.bc.ca/geoserver/cgi/ows?service=WFS&version=1.1.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=cgi%3ACA-BC-BCGS-mineral-occurrences&outputFormat=gml32&SORTBY=identifier".

Both dataset are from the same provider.

   * 1: information about the NIR
   * 2: A section providing all the dataset from a single provider: BC
   * 3: A section (collapsed in this page) providing all dataset from GSC:
   * 4: one of the dataset (in PNG)
   * 5: a link to the Infoset
