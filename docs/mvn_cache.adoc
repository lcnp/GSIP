= Cached mvn

The default Dockerfile spawn a fresh mvn container with an empty cache, therefore, each build pull all mvn dependencies at every build. Which is good for deployement , takes a lot of time when you debug and test often

`Dockerfile_mvn` can be used to create a decent pre-cache version of maven and create an image with most libraries in the image cache.
The `Dockerfile_cache` will use this image instead of the fresh image and do minimal updates, speeding the build process.

== Create the mvn container

`podman build -t mnv -f Dockerfile_mvn` (important, the name must be `mvn` otherwise you will need ti change the other Dockerfile below)

This will create an image (mvn) that will be used by `Dockerfile_cache` instead of the fresh image.

== Building using the cache

will use the `mvn` image that has a bunch 
`podman build -t mnv -f Dockerfile_cache`

This does the same job as 

`podman build -t mnv .`

just faster.
